# Elastic Search Engine Project

The Search Engine Project is a web-based search engine that utilizes Elasticsearch for indexing and searching data, along with Google API integration for fetching additional search results from Google's search engine.

## Features

- Search for content within the indexed data using Elasticsearch.
- Fetch additional search results from Google's search engine using Google API integration.
- Combine and present both Elasticsearch and Google search results to users.
- User-friendly web interface for interacting with the search engine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omoh128/search-engine-project.git
cd search-engine-project

cd backend
composer install

cd frontend
npm install

Set up Elasticsearch:

Install and configure Elasticsearch on your server or use a cloud-based Elasticsearch service.
Create an index and define the mapping for your data.
Configure Google API:

Obtain a Google API key from the Google API Console.
Add the API key to the config.php file in the backend directory.
Run the application:

Start the backend server:


cd backend
php -S localhost:8000

Start the frontend development server:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
Access the application:

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to use the search engine.

Configuration
Modify the config.php file in the backend directory to change Elasticsearch host, port, and Google API key.
You can customize the search engine's appearance and behavior by modifying the frontend code in the frontend directory.
